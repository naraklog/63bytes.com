Use this post to verify the outline placement and heading detection.

## Why an outline exists

The outline helps readers jump to the part they need without scrolling forever.

### Benefits

-   Skim sections quickly.
-   See overall structure at a glance.
-   Spot the hierarchy between sections.

### When to hide it

On very narrow viewports it should float; when there is room it should sit beside the article.

## Implementation notes

This section exists to test another level-2 heading.

### Heading IDs

IDs are generated from the text (and de-duped), so links like `#heading-ids` should work.

### Nested bullet lists

-   Level two item
    -   Level three item
    -   Another level three item

## Long-form body (for timer test)

This section deliberately contains more words so we can verify the automatic reading estimate climbs as expected. The copy is intentionally verbose and slightly repetitive, mirroring how a real article might meander while still delivering value to the reader. Think of it as a stress test for the outline, the typography, and the reading-time calculation that now runs on every build.

### Problem framing

When readers land on a long article they quickly ask themselves three questions: _What is this about?_, _How long will it take?_, and _Where should I jump in?_ The first answer belongs in the title and the dek. The second is now computed automatically from the MDX body. The third is solved by the outline that mirrors your heading structure in real time. Getting any of these wrong means higher bounce rates and lower completion, which is why we are exercising the system with extra content.

### Conversational explanation

A good outline is like an annotated table of contents. It should show hierarchy, not just a flat list. That means your `##` headings become parents, `###` headings nest under them, and so on. The page component should anchor-scroll smoothly, and the sticky sidebar should respect the viewport without overlapping key UI like the nav or newsletter bar.

### Detailed walkthrough

1. **Collect headings:** During rendering, the MDX content is parsed and each heading with an `id` attribute is collected. We rely on `rehype-slug` to generate those IDs.
2. **Build the tree:** As the headings stream in, build a tree so the outline can nest properly. A naive list would flatten everything and lose context.
3. **Handle overflow:** On small screens, collapse or hide the outline to avoid stealing precious horizontal space. On large screens, make it sticky but bound its height so it does not cover the footer.
4. **Sync scroll state:** Highlight the heading that is currently visible in the viewport. This requires intersection observers and some throttling so the UI remains smooth.
5. **Test edge cases:** Very long headings, repeated headings, or headings with inline code should all still produce valid IDs and readable labels.

### Narrative filler for word count

Shipping a solid reading experience is not just a design exercise. You need to balance performance, accessibility, and editorial control. Server Components fetch data without blocking the client, but they also need hydration boundaries to avoid jarring jumps. Meanwhile, authors want to drop in callouts, images, and code samples without breaking the flow. Every extra component adds a few more words—and therefore a few more seconds—to the reading-time calculation.

Consider a hypothetical product update post. It opens with a quick summary, dives into a timeline of events, shows before-and-after screenshots, and ends with a roadmap. Each of those sections may carry a different tone and density. The calculator treats all words the same, but readers do not. Dense code-heavy sections feel slower to process than short bullet lists, even if the word count is identical. Our goal is not perfection; it is a consistent heuristic that sets expectations.

### Additional filler paragraphs

Performance budgets still matter. If your outline component triggers layout shift, readers will abandon the page no matter what the timer says. Keep images lazy-loaded, prefer `next/image`, and ensure fonts are preloaded to avoid flash-of-unstyled-text. Also watch for cumulative layout shift when ads or embeds load late.

Accessibility deserves equal attention. Heading levels should never skip (avoid jumping from `##` straight to `####`). The outline should be keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly. Landmarks, `aria-label`s, and logical tab order all help users who rely on assistive tech.

Localization is another subtlety. If you translate posts, the reading-time estimate should ideally use a words-per-minute value that matches your target language, because average reading speeds differ. For now we keep a single constant (200 wpm), but you could parameterize it per locale if needed.

### More copy to push length

Even after a reader has scanned the outline and the estimated time to read, they may bail if the introduction feels thin. That is why strong intros matter: they promise a payoff that justifies the time investment. Throughout this demo text we maintain momentum with short sentences, occasional lists, and clear signposting.

The outline plus timer pair nicely with content metrics. You can instrument scroll depth, outline-click events, and toggle states to see whether readers use the navigation aids or ignore them. Those signals inform whether to iterate on spacing, typography, or the algorithm that marks the active heading.

### Closing thoughts

This intentionally long section should drive the automatic estimate well beyond the previous three-minute placeholder. If you see the label adjust after rebuild, the feature is working. If not, double-check that the MDX is being parsed by `gray-matter`, the content string is passed into the calculator, and the label is rendered without a fallback.
