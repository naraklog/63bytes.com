The App Router bakes in smart defaults, but real products still need custom policies.

```tsx title="HeroImage.tsx" caption="asdfsfds" {1-3,6} showLineNumbers={true}
import Image from "next/image";

export function HeroImage() {
	return (
		<Image
			src="/images/hero.avif"
			alt="Dashboard" 
			priority
			sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw"
			className="rounded-3xl border border-black/10"
		/>
	);
}
```

Combine that with `HeroImage{:.entity.name.function}` on secondary media and you get predictable LCP even when MDX authors drop galleries into posts.
