Agents tend to over-trust their tools. The antidote is _multiple sandboxes_:

1. Run tools in containers with egress policies.
2. Validate every command the agent wants to run.
3. Echo inputs back through a red-team prompt to search for injections.

```yaml
Human: summarize this email
Model: need IMAP access
Guard: command denied; IMAP scope is read-only
```

With MDX you can interleave callouts, rendered components, and Markdown footnotes[^1].

[^1]: The footnote syntax comes from `remark-gfm`.
