We treated the migration as a series of *compatibility layers* rather than a single flag day.

### Steps we checked off

- [x] Move routing logic into `/app` while keeping CRA bootstrapping for auth pages.
- [x] Switch shared UI to Server Components and hoist client-only bits behind `use client` boundaries.
- [ ] Replace bespoke webpack aliases; this work is in progress.

### Lessons learned

> Partial hydration is the cheapest win. Rendering the hero card on the server shaved ~200ms for free.

```tsx
// app/(marketing)/Hero.tsx
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

const LiveNumbers = dynamic(() => import("./LiveNumbers"), { ssr: false });

export default function Hero() {
	return (
		<section>
			<h1>Meet the searchable backlog</h1>
			<LiveNumbers />
		</section>
	);
}
```
