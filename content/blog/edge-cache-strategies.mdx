Edge caches fail when invalidation lags deploys. We fix that with **structured tags** and background revalidation.

### Tag vocabulary

| Tag | Scope | Example invalidation trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `page:/blog` | All blog listing pages | Scheduled publish |
| `post:how-fluid-compute-works-on-vercel` | A single post | Author edits content |
| `asset:hero` | Hero image sprite sheet | CDN rollouts |

### Deployment hook

```ts
await fetch("https://edge.example.com/purge", {
	method: "POST",
	headers: { "x-api-key": process.env.EDGE_CACHE_KEY! },
	body: JSON.stringify({ tags: ["post:" + slug, "page:/blog"] }),
});
```

Pair that with MDX frontmatter for hero images and you can drop in the right cache tags per post.
