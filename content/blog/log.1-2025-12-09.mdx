title: "A Journal of my Experiments"
description: "All this while my thoughts and ideas have lived as scattered notes: some half baked projects in my notebook, few philosophical questions in a tab and my abstract psych theories tucked somewhere in between. The result being, I never got around to biulding those projects or sharing my crazy theories with the world. This blog is my attempt to pin them down as well as give a direction to my own life."

This blog won’t follow a fixed style. I’d rather let ideas take shape on their own instead of forcing them into a format too early.

## About me

I spend most of my time building things on the internet. I like to understand systems end to end and think through the design before I start writing code. I work across backend, frontend, AI and crypto if it helps get the thing from idea to reality.
What keeps me interested is a mix of curiosity and the satisfaction of creating something that didn’t exist before. This blog is an extension of that: a place to think out loud, share experiments in public, and keep a record of ideas that would otherwise stay scattered across notes and chats.

Away from the keyboard, I’m usually travelling or in the gym. I’m also a hobbyist photographer and a coffee addict. A weird obsession of mine has been trying to understand why people think the way they do, how decisions form, and why certain behaviours repeat. I often end up creating my own theories just to see if they hold up in the real world. I will document these theories here as well.

## What is 63?

In short, 63 is my [42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#The_Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything_is_42). It’s not a joke or an inside reference. It’s a number that kept showing up in moments when I was learning something important about how I think, how I work, and how I move through life. Over time it became a shorthand for the small lessons that shaped me.
I don’t treat it as a lucky charm or a symbol. It’s more of a pointer. A reminder that most insights arrive quietly, from unexpected places, and often as fragments rather than complete ideas. "six three" became the label I put on those fragments.

Coincidentally, 63 is also the ASCII code for **`?`**, which fits the spirit of this blog — a place for questions, curiosities, and unfinished ideas.
I needed a place to think in public without treating everything like content. Somewhere to document what I’m building, what I’m learning, and my questions — hence the name _63bytes_.
